# My Favorite Series 🎬  
## Stranger Things  

I love **Stranger Things** because of its exciting mix of *mystery*, *sci-fi*, and *nostalgia*.  
Here are some things I enjoy about it:  

- Interesting characters like Eleven and Dustin  
- Cool 80’s vibe  
- Suspenseful storylines  

> “Friends don’t lie.” – Eleven
